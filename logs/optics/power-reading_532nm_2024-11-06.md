I am not happy with the touch-up alignment from November 5, 2024. My cause for
alarm is the significantly reduced output at the sample under the 100x
objective. I spent more time today touching up alignment into the single-mode
fiber.

Configuration
: Verdi -> 10x objective -> SM fiber -> LL filter -> 50:50 BS -> Obj -> Sample -> Obj -> 50:50 BS -> MM assembly out

Diode current
: 23.52 A
