Found box labeled "WITEC stuff" containing 9 cantilevers and 7 probes with apertures as well as 15 "practice tips."

-   Removed SNOM objective endcap by loosening tiny screw on the side

-   Attached practice cantilever to endcap by placing the two washers on top of each other (not an easy task), as per the image on page 115 of WITEC manual.

-   Re-attached endcap to SNOM objective

 

Collection CCD (below microscope)

-   ScanCtrl didn't seem to recognize it so I unplugged it and tested with a multimeter, which showed 29V DC. Plugged it back in and it worked after a small delay.

-   Z motor (controlling collection objective) appears to be on its way out and only sometimes responds to the handheld controller. X and Y motors function better but are slightly jerky at slow speeds.

-   Manual focus knob bypasses Z motor and allows for focusing. Was able to get an image of coverslip from below on ScanCtrl.

-   *Microscope* z-stage doesn't go down far enough to allow for focusing

    -   Was able to get the collection objective high enough to focus on the field stop by placing the coverslip on a 1" tall ring and feeding the collection objective through the hole.
