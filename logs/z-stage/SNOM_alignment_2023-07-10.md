Focused excitation beam onto tiny hole in cantilever tip. Can't see beam deflection laser as it is likely in the near-IR. No reading on photodetector on vs off. Adjusting T-B and position of cantilever does not change photodetector reading (T-B or sigma on Beam Deflection Module). Oscilloscope coupled to the T-B output also does not read anything. Maybe test with the Verdi at lowest power?

Â 

Adjustment screws on the SNOM objective only move the x-y stage (in the objective) in one direction. Likely something wrong with the spring pushing on the stage in the opposite direction.

-   Spring too weak to push against friction force. Manually pushing on stage does not move it either. Will have to use vice to force it to move. Maybe graphite as a lubricant? Easy to dust off lens if it gets on it vs oil/grease will ruin it.

-   Likely will have to buy another SNOM objective. No explicit SNOM objective listed on Nikon, Zeiss, Edmund, Witec, or Martock Products (manufacturer listed on objective and now part of Elliot Scientific). Will have to call tomorrow to see if anybody might have something that could work.
