The washer that was already on the endcap is actually an old broken AFM tip. I removed it, exposing a bare magnet that the tips could be attached to.

 

Collection CCD still having issues connecting, this time coax is not showing any voltage.

-   Poor coax connection to CCD camera: lightly touching connection below microscope fixed issue.

 

Able to focus on top of cantilever through top objective once mounted.

 

Deflection Laser (785 nm, 1-5 mW according to manual)

-   Does not seem to be working.
